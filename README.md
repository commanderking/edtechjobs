# Boston EdTech Foundation Job Board

This is the repo for the Boston EdTech Job board currently located ["here"](http://localhost:3000/).

Until we better understand user needs, we are manually updating this board about every two weeks.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
